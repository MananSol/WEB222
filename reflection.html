            <h1>What is responsive web design?</h1>
            <li>
                <p>Responsive web design basically means that design should be perfectly matched to any type of devices with any type of size. <mark>It generally depends on the screen size and the orientation of the device.</mark> And Once we add the function for the responsive web design, then website will automatically manage the screen size for every other devices. Infact, all the website that have been build over the past few years are responsive websites. Sometimes it is hard to manage alignments, but the automated functions make it very easy that it automatically matches the height and width of the particular device.</p>
            </li>
                <h1>How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h1>
            <li>
                <p>We all know that we need to work very fast and prior and for that we need a fast connection and a good website. <strong> What makes a website good?</strong> Obviously a good website design. And now, we have a best thing, which is a responsive web design. Responsive design has moved the worl a lot fater than ever only because of the less lagging.</p>
            </li>
                <h1>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</h1>
            <li>
                <p>It is undoubetdly clear that I have learnt many things in web development, especially in this course. I came to know about <mark>Java Script, CSS, and HTML</mark>, and how they implements their tasks in the website very pricesly. For example, java scripts is useful to implement the <mark>complex functions and algorithms </mark> in the website. It can also be usful for fun things in the site, like 2d/3D content, or maps etc. Then HTML, which is used to  <mark>establish sections, headers, foorter, titles, paragraphs, sections, tags, and elements.</mark> By all these things, we can create a full structure of the website, which helps us to modify the content through various sources. And lastly, CSS, CSS used to make the website more attractive. We can add  <mark>animations, colors and many more things </mark> which can beautify out website.</p>
            </li>
                <h1>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.</h1>
            <li>
                <p>As I told, I have learnt many many things throughout the course, but what I liked the most is the assignment part. The assignments were structured in a way that covers evry thing that we have learnt thoughout the term. And also, it helped a lot when it comes to implement in the real world. When it comes to quizes, it was fun. However, it was a little hard for me at the some point of the course, but eventually I got over it. Even though that was fun part as I learned how fast we have to be in order to solve problems as soon as possible.</p>
